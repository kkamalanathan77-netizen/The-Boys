    <h2>💫 How The Boys® Was Created</h2>

    <p>
        It all started on a special day in our school. For Independence Day, 
        our school mam conducted a dance program and selected some members 
        from our class to perform.
    </p>

    <p>
        That practice session brought us together. We laughed, we worked hard, 
        we supported each other, and slowly we became more than just classmates.
    </p>

    <p>
        On that day, something special happened — we became best friends.
        From that moment, we decided to create our own group and proudly named it 
        <strong>The Boys®</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our group always keeps us joyful, united, and strong. 
        We study together, laugh together, solve problems together, 
        and stand by each other no matter what.
    </p>

    <p>
        From that Independence Day to this very day, our bond has only grown stronger.
        We are not just friends — we are a team, a family, and brothers forever.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight-line">
        And this is just the beginning of The Boys® journey... 🚀🔥
    </p>
